<p>In my last year of university, I did not understand what I liked.
  <br>In practice, before graduation, I was hired.
  <br>I became the administrator of three sites.
  <br>While working, I noticed my interest.
  <br>I started to understand how the site works.
  <br>To date, I have completed the basic HTML, CSS, Java Script course at https://code-basics.com.
  <br>And now I'm doing the first assignment in the basic frontend course at rsschool.
  <br>I hope that everything will work out for me and I will create sites that are understandable and convenient for people.</p>
